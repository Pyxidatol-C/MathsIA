\section{Introduction}
If a large, porous stone is immersed in water for a long time, what is the probability that its centre is wetted? In 1957, Broadbent and Hammersley \autocite*[693]{broadbent_hammersley_1957} formulated a simple stochastic model for this situation, which in two dimensions amounts to a large grid of channels. More specifically, we consider the graph $G = (V, E)$, where the set of vertices $V$ is the square lattice $\Z^2$, and all the edges that connect two neighbouring points $A$ and $B$ on the square lattice, i.e.\ $\abs{A_x - B_x} + \abs{A_y - B_y} = 1$, constitute the set of edges $E$. We then choose a certain $p \in [0, 1]$, and for each edge (alternatively called \textit{bond}) $e$ in $E$, we declare $e$ to be \textit{open} with probability $p$, and \textit{closed} otherwise with probability $1 - p$ independently of the states of other edges. This model is known as Bernoulli bond percolation.

The edges represent the inner passageways of the stone, where open edges let water through and closed ones block the flow; water reaches the centre of the stone if and only if the origin is in a connected component of open edges touching the boundary of the stone. In addition, it is not unreasonable to assume that the fine structure of the interior channels is on a negligible scale compared to the overall size of the stone. We are then interested in knowing whether the origin belongs to a connected component of infinitely many vertices, also called an \textit{infinite cluster}. 

Apart from $p = 0$ where the stone is entirely impermeable, and $p = 1$ where water flows surely past the origin, to have an idea of how the model behaves at other nontrivial values of $p$, we can contemplate computer simulations of a finite section of the square lattice:

Readers with good eyesight may bother to check that for $p = 0.6$, there is a path of open edges (in red) connecting the left and right sides, whereas such is not the case for $p = 0.2$ and $p = 0.3$ where the connected components are isolated. Is there a value of the parameter $p$ at which infinite clusters emerge? Can we compute this critical value of $p$? Is the critical value different for the cubic lattice $\Z^3$?

What is described above forms the basis of percolation theory. Since its birth in 1957 due to Broandbent and Hammersley \autocite*[693]{broadbent_hammersley_1957}, the field has attracted pure mathematicians and scientists from myriad domains. Despite its simplicity, the percolation model accounts for the behaviour of many natural systems --- ranging from the flow of fluids through a disordered porous medium and conductivity of materials to the spread of forest fires and epidemics \autocite[60]{gennes_2000}. Nevertheless, the first major mathematical result was not announced until only some twenty years later: in 1980, Kesten \autocite*[41]{kesten_1980} completed Harris and Lindley's \autocite*[13]{harris_lindley_1960} 1960 work to prove that the critical probability on the square lattice is equal to $\frac{1}{2}$. In the last two decades, there has been remarkable progress in our understanding of two-dimensional percolation due to Smirnov's \autocite*[239]{smirnov_2001} proof of the conformal invariance on the hexagonal lattice, for which he was awarded the Fields Medal in 2010.

To answer the questions raised above about the existence of the critical probability on the square and cubic lattices, we will firstly acquaint ourselves with a few notions in probability to allow for a rigorous discussion of the subject.

\section{Probabilistic Preliminaries}
We shall not get burdened with the measure-theoretic details about the probability space, but to avoid juggling with infinities in the model, some formal definitions are required.

\begin{defn}\label{defn:outcome_and_event}
We call a percolation sample an \textit{outcome}; e.g., the leftmost panel of \cref{fig:3_realisations} shows an outcome when $p = 0.2$. An \textit{event} is a set of zero or more outcomes, and depends on finitely many edges. We say an event \textit{occurs} if the outcome belongs to the event.
\end{defn}

\begin{ex}\label{ex:cluster_of_size_n}
Let $n$ be a nonnegative integer. Recall that a \textit{self-avoiding path} of length $n$ is a sequence of vertices $v_1, v_2, \dots, v_{n + 1}$ that are all distinct.
Let $C$ be the set of vertices that are connected to the origin $O$ via open edges (with $O \in C$). We define the event
\[
\{\abs{C} \geq n + 1\}
= \{\text{there is a self-avoiding path of open edges of length } n \text{ from } O\}
\]
where $\abs{C}$ denotes the size of the cluster $C$.
\input{figures/cluster_self_avoiding_path.tex}
\end{ex}

Note that we use $\P(A)$ instead of the habitual $P(A)$ to denote the probability of an event $A$ occurring, because it depends on the value of the parameter $p$. Nonetheless, the probabilities of any two events $A$ and $B$ satisfy the following as usual:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\P(A \cup B) = \P(A) + \P(B) - \P(A \cap B)$;
    \item $A$ and $B$ are \textit{independent} if and only if $\P(A \cap B) = \P(A) \P(B)$;
    \item $0 \leq \P(A) \leq 1$ --- in particular, $\P(\varnothing) = 0$.
\end{itemize}

\begin{lem}\label{lem:event_subseteq}
If the occurrence of event $A$ implies the occurrence of event $B$, then $$\P(A) \leq \P(B).$$
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
By \cref{defn:outcome_and_event}, we see that $A$ and $B$ are two sets of outcomes where, for all $\omega \in A$, we also have $\omega \in B$. Hence $A \subseteq B$, and 
\begin{align*}
    \P(B) 
    &= \P(A \cup (B \setminus A))\\
    &= \P(A) + \P(B \setminus A) - \P(A \cap (B \setminus A))\\
    &\geq \P(A)
\end{align*}
since $A \cap (B \setminus A) = \varnothing$ and $\P(B \setminus A) \geq 0$.
\end{proof}

\begin{cor}\label{cor:inf_cluster}
Using the definition from \cref{ex:cluster_of_size_n}, for integers $m$ and $n$, if $n > m \geq 0$, we have $\{\abs{C} \geq n\} \subseteq \{\abs{C} \geq m\}$ and hence $\P(\abs{C} \geq n) \leq \P(\abs{C} \geq m)$. We then define
\[
\P(\abs{C} = \infty) 
= \lim_{n \to \infty} \P(\text{there is a self-avoiding path of open edges of length } n \text{ from } O).
\]
\end{cor}
We also use $\theta(p)$ to refer to the probability that there is an infinite cluster at the origin as a function of $p$.

\section{Percolation on the Square Lattice}
\subsection{No Infinite Clusters}
To start with, we want to know for which values of $p$ (apart from $p = 0$, more specifically) there is no infinite cluster on the square lattice, i.e., $\theta(p) = 0$.

Let $n$ be a nonnegative integer, and let $\Omega_n$ be the set of all self-avoiding paths of length $n$ departing from the origin. \Cref{cor:inf_cluster} tells us that
\[\theta(p) = \lim_{n \to \infty} \P(\bigcup_{\gamma \in \Omega_n} \text{all edges of the path } \gamma \text{ are open}).\]
We can then find an upper bound on $\theta(p)$ with the help of the following lemma.

\begin{lem}[Boole's inequality]\label{lem:union_bound}
$\P(A_1 \cup A_2 \cup \cdots \cup A_n) \leq \P(A_1) + \P(A_2) + \cdots + \P(A_n)$
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}[Proof]
We proceed by induction on $n$. Let $\mathcal{P}(n): P(\bigcup_{i = 1}^n A_i) \leq \sum_{i = 1}^n P(A_i)$ for  $n \in \N$.
\begin{description}
\item \textit{Base case.} We have $P(A_1) \leq P(A_1)$, and hence $\mathcal{P}(1)$ is true.
\item \textit{Inductive step.} Assume that $\mathcal{P}(k)$ is true for a certain $k \in \N$; show that $\mathcal{P}(k + 1)$ is true.
We use the associative property of the union operation:
\begin{align*}
    P(\bigcup_{i = 1}^{k + 1} A_i) 
    &= P(\bigcup_{i = 1}^{k} A_i \cup A_{k + 1})\\
    &= P(\bigcup_{i = 1}^{k} A_i) + P(A_{k + 1}) - P(\bigcup_{i = 1}^{k} A_i \cap A_{k + 1})\\
    &\leq \sum_{i = 1}^k P(A_i) + P(A_{k + 1}) - P(\bigcup_{i = 1}^{k} A_i \cap A_{k + 1})\\
\end{align*}
Since $P(\bigcup_{i = 1}^{k} A_i \cap A_{k + 1}) \geq 0$, we can conclude that $P(\bigcup_{i = 1}^{k + 1} A_i) \leq \sum_{i = 1}^{k + 1} P(A_i)$.
\end{description}
By the principle of mathematical induction, $\mathcal{P}(n)$ is true for any $n \in \N$.
\end{proof}

It follows that
\[\theta(p) \leq \lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{\gamma \in \Omega_n} \P(\text{all edges of the path } \gamma \text{ are open}).\]

\begin{prop}
$\P(\text{all edges of } \gamma \text{ are open}) = p^n$ for all path $\gamma \in \Omega_n$.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
By the definition of the set $\Omega_n$, the self-avoiding path $\gamma$ contains $n$ distinct edges. Furthermore, each edge $e$ in $\gamma$ is defined to independently be open with probability $p$. Thus, the probability that all edges of the given path is open is $\prod_{e \in \gamma} p = p^n$.
\end{proof}

\begin{prop}
There are at most $4 \cdot 3^{n - 1}$ self-avoiding paths in $\Omega_n$.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
\input{figures/nb_self_avoiding_paths.tex}
Using the reasoning from \cref{fig:nb_self_avoiding_path} above, we can deduce that $\abs{\Omega_n} \leq 4 \times 3^{n - 1}$.
\end{proof}

Although we have only obtained a very crude bound on the number of paths in $\Omega_n$, we can still conclude that
\begin{align*}
    \theta(p)
    &\leq \lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{\gamma \in \Omega_n} p^n\\
    &\leq \lim_{n \to \infty} (4 \cdot 3^{n - 1}) p^n\\
    &= \dfrac{4}{3} \lim_{n \to \infty} (3p)^{n - 1}
\end{align*}
which tends toward 0 if $3p < 1$.

\begin{thm}
If $p < \dfrac{1}{3}$, then $\theta(p) = 0$.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
As shown above, $p < \frac{1}{3}$ implies $\theta(p) \leq 0$. But since $\theta(p) \geq 0$ as a probability, $\theta(p) = 0$. As a result, there is no infinite cluster on the square lattice if $p < \frac{1}{3}$.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Infinite Clusters}
Then, we are interested in knowing for which values of $p$ (other than $p = 1$) there exists an infinite cluster, i.e.\ $\theta(p) > 0$.

This time, we will be employing a more elaborated method that is often called a \textit{Peierls argument}. It is named after the British physicist \autocite[477]{peierls_1936} who proved a phase transition --- the change of macroscopic behaviour as the parameter varies, e.g.\ the appearance of an infinite cluster --- for the Ising model, another probabilistic model in statistical physics that explains the phenomenon of ferromagnetism. The gist is that, instead of trying to find a direct lower bound on $\theta(p)$, we establish an upper bound on $1 - \theta(p)$ using a variant of the technique from the previous section. The method revolves around the \textit{dual graph} $\left(\Z^2\right)^*$, a key notion that we will introduce now.

\begin{defn}
Given a planar graph $G$, we define its \textit{dual graph} $G^*$ such that:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $G^*$ has a vertex for each face delimited by edges of $G$;
    \item an edge connects two vertices of $G^*$ if the corresponding faces are separated by an edge of $G$.
\end{itemize}
\end{defn}
\begin{ex}
Consider $\left(\Z^2\right)^*$, the dual graph of the square lattice $\Z^2$ and its edges.
\input{figures/square_lattice_dual.tex}

We observe that the graph $\Z^2$ is \textit{self-dual}: by a vector translation of $(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2})$, each vertex and each edge of $\Z^2$ uniquely correspond to a vertex and an edge in $(\Z^2)^*$ respectively. Moreover, concerning percolation, we declare each edge $e^*$ of $(\Z^2)^*$ to be open (resp.\ closed) if the edge $e$ of $\Z^2$ that $e^*$ crosses is closed (resp.\ open).
\end{ex}

``Quite apart from the fact that percolation theory had its origin in an honest applied problem, it is a source of fascinating problems of the best kind a mathematician can wish for: problems which are easy to state with a minimum of preparation, but whose solutions are (apparently) difficult and require new methods.''
